## QUEUE
<hr />
**FIFO - First In, First Out**
Smallest index is the first to be accessed (LEFT TO RIGHT) 
Like a line at a ticket booth. First in line, first to be served.

### Methods
JavaScript and Python both have native array/list methods that emulate queue functions. A queue is a more limited data structure compared to its implementations in each language.

Enqueuing/ Adding -> array.unshift()
Dequeuing/Removing -> array.pop()
