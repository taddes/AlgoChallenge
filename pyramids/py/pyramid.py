#  --- Directions
#  Write a function that accepts a positive number N.
#  The function should console log a pyramid shape
#  with N levels using the # character.  Make sure the
#  pyramid has spaces on both the left *and* right hand sides
#  --- Examples
#    pyramid(1)
#        '#'
#    pyramid(2)
#        ' # '
#        '###'
#    pyramid(3)
#        '  #  '
#        ' ### '
#        '#####'
