Array Chunking Exercise

Given a list/array of length n and a number of length n, return a new list/array of 
sub arrays/sub lists of size n. Make sure any variables outside of an even chunk are 
in their own list.

Function of 2 given inputs, an array and a number
Create an empty array to push chunked values to
Iterate through the 'unchunked' array:
    retrieve the last element in the 'chunked' array (first time, it's empty/undefined)
    IF last element does not exist, or its length is equal to chunk size:
        Push a new chunk to 'chunked' array with the current element
    ELSE
        add the current element into the chunk
