## Linked Lists - Chain of Nodes
* An ordered collection of data that contains a number of nodes. Each node contains some data and a pointer to the next node.
* Order of the linked list are
* Head node -> nodes -> Tail node
* Head node is originator of linked list. No ref prior to it.
* Tail node does not have a reference to any node

* All nodes have two components:
    1. A data bucket (array, object, integer)
    2. Reference to next node along the chain.
