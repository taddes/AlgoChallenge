## Merge Sort
Split into two sorted arrays of values
Create 'results' array.
While there are still elements in both arrays:
    If the first element the left half is less than the right half:
        shift the element form left into a result array
    else
        shift the element from right into a result array
Take everything from the array that still has stuff in it and put in the results.
